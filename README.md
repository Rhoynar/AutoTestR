# AutoTestR

---

# Description
AutoTestR provides a framework and library for automatically generating page objects for any given web-application based on their sitemap. It can also be used for generating page object test code individually for any given web-application (including single page application).

AutoTestR parses the Document Object Model (DOM) for the web-pages in order to generate corresponding page-object for that web-page. AutoTestR also generates test cases automatically by using a network (graph) model.

# How to use it
In order to use AutoTestR, nodeJS must be installed on your machine. Use the following command to generate the page objects for a given site-map.

```
node generator.js sitemap.xml
```
